# Technical-Communications

## This repository serves as a set of projects dealing with multiple aspects of communicating with different audiences with a specific fictional scenario. 

### Task 1 Scenario Setting:
My company is considering the implementation of a technology solution to address a business problem for Google. As a member of the IT team, I was asked to select a solution to address the identified needs. I must uniquely inform two audiences in the company about what the solution is and its benefits. I've created two artifacts communicating this information tailored to meet the needs of each of the following groups:

* Audience 1: executive leadership of the organization, such as the CIO, CFO, etc.
* Audience 2: cross-functional team, including members from IT who will be implementing the product

<b>Audience 1</b>:
The executive leadership of an organization includes the key decision makers and visionaries. A new idea presented to them should be formatted quite differently from other levels of the organization. 

<b>Audience 2</b>:
A cross-functional team includes representatives from a variety of departments in a company. Each of these individuals has their own expertise and primary areas of focus. Presenting ideas to this group requires an astute sense of what is and is not known and how to communicate so everyone fully comprehends the idea. 

With these two different audiences, I will need to communicate the following: 

* Internal Communication Artifact
* Fact Sheet Artifacts
* A Written Process Analysis for Each Artifact 
* Audience Analysis for Each Artifact 
* Sources

### Task 2 Scenario Setting:
Write a professional proposal based on a given Request for Proposal (RFP) document from the Seamus Company.
